.Sh NAME
.Nm rset
.Nd configure systems using labeled scripts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rset
.Op Fl ln
.Op Fl f Ar route_file
.Ar host_regex
.Op Ar label
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
evaluates script fragments written in Progressive Label Notation
.Pq Xr pln 5 ,
executing each one in tern using ssh connection multiplexing.
.Nm
requires one parameter specifying the regular expression matching hosts
to configure.
A
.Ar label
name may be specified in order to run scripts with a specific label name.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
List the name of each label before execution.
.It Fl n
Do not execute commands.
Instead hostnames are highlighted to show what characters the
.Ar host_regex
matched.
.It Fl f
Specify a
.Ar route_file .
This file is composed of labels which correspond to
hostnames or IP addresses which are matched against
.Ar host_regex .
The default is
.Pa routes.pln .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Execution on the remote host sets the following environment variables:
.Ev LABEL ,
.Ev INSTALL_URL .
.Sh FILES
Available hosts and the pathnames to labeled scripts to run are read from
.Pa routes.pln ,
located in the current directory.
.Pp
A ssh master is established at the beginning of a session and all subsequent
interactions with a host are run over a socket at
.Pa /tmp/rset_control_{hostname} .
.Pp
The local directory
.Pa _rutils
must exist, and is shipped to the remote host at the beginning of each
execution as a temporary directory named
.Pa /tmp/rset_staging_{http_port} .
This is used to set the current working directory in the environment of the
remote host, hence the capabilities of
.Nm
may easily be extend by accessing utilities at this location.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Pa Most options are not set in the command line, but are modified using key
value-pairs.
.Ss \&username=
The username to connect as.
This parameter has no default.
.Ss \&interpreter=
The interpreter to run a script fragment with.
Defaults to
.Pa /bin/sh ,
but any language may be used that is capable of reading scripts over STDIN.
.Ss \&execute_using=
Command for elevating privileges, such as
.Xr doas 1
and
.Xr sudo 8 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ssh_config 5 ,
.Xr re_format 7
